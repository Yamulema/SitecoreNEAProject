Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />
            <ul>
                <li> To comply with applicable law;</li>

Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />
            <ul>
                <li> To comply with applicable law;</li>

        <br />
        <strong>V. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br />

Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />
            <ul>
                <li> To comply with applicable law;</li>
                <li>•	To perform a legitimate business purpose that is consistent with our brand values and nonprofit mission of serving SEIU members;</li>
                <li>To protect against any security threats, fraud and other wrongdoing; and</li>
                <li>In accordance with any consents that you may provide us.</li>

        <br />
        <strong>V. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br />
        <br />

We also share Personal Information with Third Parties as described below: <br />
        <ul>

The Personal Information shared is limited (generally email address, phone number, and/or physical address) and is used by the network to confirm delivery of our content to the proper recipient. Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />
            <ul>
                <li> To comply with applicable law;</li>
                <li>&bull;	To perform a legitimate business purpose that is consistent with our brand values and nonprofit mission of serving SEIU members;</li>
                <li>To protect against any security threats, fraud and other wrongdoing; and</li>
                <li>In accordance with any consents that you may provide us.</li>
            </ul>

Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />
            <ul>
                <li> To comply with applicable law;</li>

            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />

Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />

The Personal Information shared is limited (generally email address, phone number, and/or physical address) and is used by the network to confirm delivery of our content to the proper recipient. Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>To comply with applicable law;</li>
                <li>To perform a legitimate business purpose that is consistent with our brand values and nonprofit mission of serving SEIU members;</li>
                <li>To protect against any security threats, fraud and other wrongdoing; and</li>
                <li>In accordance with any consents that you may provide us.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        </ul>

        <br />
        <strong>V. HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br />
        <br />
        In order to efficiently and effectively serve SEIU members in support of our nonprofit mission, we routinely share the Personal Information that we collect about you, as described in Section III (Types of Personal Information Collected and How We Collect It) with SEIU and SEIU&rsquo;s Locals. We also share Personal Information with Third Parties as described below: <br />
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Providers:</strong> We share Personal Information with our Product Providers. Through legal contracts, we require that our Product Providers treat any Personal Information that we share as confidential, and use it solely in connection with the SEIU MB program. If you purchase a product from our Product Providers, our Product Providers will separately collect Personal Information about you, and may share some of it with us, as described in Section III (Types of Personal Information Collected and How We Collect It).

Our Product Providers will use any Personal Information that they independently collect as described in their own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Vendors:</strong> We share Personal Information with our Vendors.

            <li><strong>Social and Digital Advertising Networks:</strong> We share Personal Information with social and digital advertising networks to deliver targeted advertising on their network. The Personal Information shared is limited (generally email address, phone number, and/or physical address) and is used by the network to confirm delivery of our content to the proper recipient. Your ability to opt-out of such content is governed by the privacy policies of the social and digital advertising networks, not this Privacy Policy.</li>
            In addition to the above disclosures, we also may share your Personal Information with other Third Parties as follows:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>To comply with applicable law;</li>
                <li>To perform a legitimate business purpose that is consistent with our brand values and nonprofit mission of serving SEIU members;</li>
                <li>To protect against any security threats, fraud and other wrongdoing; and</li>
                <li>In accordance with any consents that you may provide us.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        Any shared Personal Information, when transmitted via electronic means or otherwise, is secured and protected from unauthorized use. Finally, we routinely share Non-Personal Information that we collect with Third Parties in support of the SEIU MB program.<br />
