        <p>Maybe you didn&rsquo;t withhold enough, forgot to pay estimated taxes for a side gig or you made another kind of honest mistake, and now you have a big, looming tax bill coming your way. This happens to many Americans every year, and, in certain cases, they will struggle to settle up on what they owe.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s more complicated than ever now, as a new W-4 form implemented in 2020 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act affected the withholding from paychecks. If you didn&rsquo;t update your withholdings in 2020, you may have received slightly more in your paycheck throughout the year, but that also means you could end up owing more than usual in taxes when you file in 2021.</p>
        <p>In addition, if you collected any unemployment in 2020 and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unemployment-compensation-is-taxable-have-tax-withheld-now-and-avoid-a-tax-time-surprise" target="_blank">taxes weren&rsquo;t withheld</a>, that also can bump up what you&rsquo;ll owe in the 2021 tax season. The American Rescue Plan, the latest coronavirus relief package passed in mid-March 2021, includes a waiver of federal income tax on the first $10,200 in jobless benefits received in 2020 by people who had an income under $150,000.</p>
        <p>The consequences of a large unexpected tax bill&nbsp;can grow quite costly: If you can&rsquo;t pay taxes owed by the original filing due date, you&rsquo;ll be subject to both <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc202" target="_blank">interest and late-payment penalties</a>, according to the IRS. The IRS advises taxpayers in this situation to file on time even if they can&rsquo;t pay the entire balance. And it&rsquo;s best to pay that balance as soon as possible to avoid additional charges. Specifically, the additional charges could amount to penalties of 5% of the tax due for every month, or fraction of month, that the return is overdue, according to Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Several years back, the IRS issued new rules to help soften the blow for these taxpayers,&rdquo; Luscombe says, &ldquo;including increasing the threshold at which the IRS files a lien against their property, bank account or wages, which will impact credit ratings. Despite the changes, however, you&rsquo;ll still face a host of issues for not paying when owed and need to understand the options available to address the debt.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>To learn more about five of these options, we talked to Luscombe and Shawn Spaulding, a San Marcos, Calif.-based tax attorney. As always, their advice represents their educated opinion alone. If you&rsquo;re in a situation in which you face difficulties in paying taxes owed, we advise that you seek a qualified tax professional to help you make the best decisions for your individual case. You can also learn more about tax payment options on the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc202" target="_blank">IRS website</a>.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s what they had to say.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Get an extension. </strong>In many cases, the IRS will be perfectly willing to extend your deadline to pay. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t pay the bill when it&rsquo;s due, but you feel you can do so within 120 days, you can ask and&mdash;if you owe less than $100,000&mdash;receive a short-term, administrative extension,&rdquo; Luscombe says.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Borrow to pay it off. </strong>If you need more time than 120 days, you may want to consider a bank loan&mdash;possibly through home equity&mdash;or even your credit card. To reduce the interest burden of the latter, you could transfer what you owe into a new card with a favorable, introductory rate. &ldquo;While going into debt to pay off a debt might not seem like a great option at first, the interest rate and fees assessed by a bank or credit card issuer may be lower than the interest and penalties assessed by the IRS,&rdquo; Luscombe says. &ldquo;Credit card payments must be made electronically, frequently through personal tax software or a paid tax preparer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><strong>3. Claim hardship.</strong> By being declared what the IRS calls a &ldquo;Currently Not Collectible&rdquo; account, you&rsquo;ll receive an official delay in payment if you can demonstrate that making good on what you owe to the IRS would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses. &ldquo;Being currently not collectible doesn&rsquo;t mean the debt goes away,&rdquo; according to the IRS at its official site. &ldquo;It means the IRS has determined you can&rsquo;t afford to pay the debt at this time. Penalties and interest continue to accrue until you&rsquo;ve paid off the debt in full.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In this case, the IRS asks candidates to fill out a Collection Information Statement and submit proof of financial status, which should include details about their assets, monthly income and expenses. &ldquo;Generally, a hardship status will prevent levies and garnishment for 12 months,&rdquo; says Spaulding. &ldquo;Still, if you owe more than $10,000, the IRS will record a lien in the county where you live, immediately after approving hardship status.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>As for how the IRS determines hardship cases, the agency generally assesses what should be reasonable, allowable monthly expenses. &ldquo;In other words, you can&rsquo;t claim $3,000 a month for a car payment,&rdquo; Spaulding says.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Request an &ldquo;Offer in Compromise.&rdquo; </strong>For special circumstances, the IRS will accept less than the full amount due. &ldquo;This typically happens when taxpayers show that the full debt could never be collected or they&rsquo;re disputing how much is owed,&rdquo; Luscombe says. &ldquo;But neither party wants to enter into a legal battle to resolve the issue.&rdquo; To make the request, all filings have to be current, and you can&rsquo;t be part of an open bankruptcy case.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Enter an installment plan. </strong>If you can&rsquo;t qualify for an offer of compromise, you can stretch payments (if the total is less than $50,000) over as much as 72 monthly installments. &ldquo;You do this directly through the Automated Clearing House and avoid a lien filing, garnishments and levies,&rdquo; Spaulding says. &ldquo;To qualify, you&rsquo;re not required to provide full financials like bank statements, pays stubs and bills, as with an Offer in Compromise or Currently Not Collectible situation.&rdquo; A range of user fees apply. As with an Offer in Compromise, all filings have to be current, and you can&rsquo;t be part of an open bankruptcy case.</p>
        <p><strong>How to avoid owing taxes next year</strong></p>
        <p>Obviously, you&rsquo;ll want to spare yourself from this ordeal a year from now. Spaulding suggests these 3 steps:</p>
        <p><strong>Check your W-4. </strong>You have to ensure that your exemptions are accurately listed. &ldquo;If there are too many, then your employer won&rsquo;t withhold enough taxes and you will owe,&rdquo; Spaulding says.</p>
        <p><strong>Be careful about withdrawing from your 403(b) and other retirement plans.</strong> If you&rsquo;re in a tight spot and need that money, set aside enough to pay taxes on it. &ldquo;Since those accounts are funded with pre-tax dollars, all the money you pull out will probably be subject to income tax, plus a 10% penalty in most cases,&rdquo; Spaulding says.</p>
        <p><strong>If you freelance, make estimated tax payments. </strong>Many educators have a side gig. Whether you tutor or&nbsp;launch a home-based business, you must set up an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax" target="_blank">estimated tax schedule</a> and make quarterly payments. &ldquo;The U.S. has a &lsquo;pay as you go&rsquo; system,&rdquo; Spaulding says. &ldquo;This means you&rsquo;ll remit taxes throughout the year&mdash;not just by April 15.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Maybe you didn&rsquo;t withhold enough, forgot to pay estimated taxes for a side gig or you made another kind of honest mistake, and now you have a big, looming tax bill coming your way. This happens to many Americans every year, and, in certain cases, they will struggle to settle up on what they owe.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s more complicated than ever now, as a new W-4 form implemented in 2020 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act affected the withholding from paychecks. If you didn&rsquo;t update your withholdings in 2020, you may have received slightly more in your paycheck throughout the year, but that also means you could end up owing more than usual in taxes when you file in 2021.</p>
        <p>In addition, if you collected any unemployment in 2020 and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unemployment-compensation-is-taxable-have-tax-withheld-now-and-avoid-a-tax-time-surprise" target="_blank">taxes weren&rsquo;t withheld</a>, that also can bump up what you&rsquo;ll owe in the 2021 tax season. The American Rescue Plan, the latest coronavirus relief package passed in mid-March 2021, includes a waiver of federal income tax on the first $10,200 in jobless benefits received in 2020 by people who had an income under $150,000.</p>
        <p>The consequences of a large unexpected tax bill&nbsp;can grow quite costly: If you can&rsquo;t pay taxes owed by the original filing due date, you&rsquo;ll be subject to both <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc202" target="_blank">interest and late-payment penalties</a>, according to the IRS. The IRS advises taxpayers in this situation to file on time even if they can&rsquo;t pay the entire balance. And it&rsquo;s best to pay that balance as soon as possible to avoid additional charges. Specifically, the additional charges could amount to penalties of 5% of the tax due for every month, or fraction of month, that the return is overdue, according to Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Several years back, the IRS issued new rules to help soften the blow for these taxpayers,&rdquo; Luscombe says, &ldquo;including increasing the threshold at which the IRS files a lien against their property, bank account or wages, which will impact credit ratings. Despite the changes, however, you&rsquo;ll still face a host of issues for not paying when owed and need to understand the options available to address the debt.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>To learn more about five of these options, we talked to Luscombe and Shawn Spaulding, a San Marcos, Calif.-based tax attorney. As always, their advice represents their educated opinion alone. If you&rsquo;re in a situation in which you face difficulties in paying taxes owed, we advise that you seek a qualified tax professional to help you make the best decisions for your individual case. You can also learn more about tax payment options on the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc202" target="_blank">IRS website</a>.</p>
        <p>Here&rsquo;s what they had to say.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Get an extension. </strong>In many cases, the IRS will be perfectly willing to extend your deadline to pay. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t pay the bill when it&rsquo;s due, but you feel you can do so within 120 days, you can ask<span>&mdash;</span> and if you owe less than $100,000&mdash;to receive a short-term, administrative extension,&rdquo; Luscombe says.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Borrow to pay it off. </strong>If you need more time than 120 days, you may want to consider a bank loan&mdash;possibly through home equity&mdash;or even your credit card. To reduce the interest burden of the latter, you could transfer what you owe into a new card with a favorable, introductory rate. &ldquo;While going into debt to pay off a debt might not seem like a great option at first, the interest rate and fees assessed by a bank or credit card issuer may be lower than the interest and penalties assessed by the IRS,&rdquo; Luscombe says. &ldquo;Credit card payments must be made electronically, frequently through personal tax software or a paid tax preparer.&rdquo;</p>
        <p><strong>3. Claim hardship.</strong> By being declared what the IRS calls a &ldquo;Currently Not Collectible&rdquo; account, you&rsquo;ll receive an official delay in payment if you can demonstrate that making good on what you owe to the IRS would prevent you from meeting your basic living expenses. &ldquo;Being currently not collectible doesn&rsquo;t mean the debt goes away,&rdquo; according to the IRS at its official site. &ldquo;It means the IRS has determined you can&rsquo;t afford to pay the debt at this time. Penalties and interest continue to accrue until you&rsquo;ve paid off the debt in full.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>In this case, the IRS asks candidates to fill out a Collection Information Statement and submit proof of financial status, which should include details about their assets, monthly income and expenses. &ldquo;Generally, a hardship status will prevent levies and garnishment for 12 months,&rdquo; says Spaulding. &ldquo;Still, if you owe more than $10,000, the IRS will record a lien in the county where you live, immediately after approving hardship status.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>As for how the IRS determines hardship cases, the agency generally assesses what should be reasonable, allowable monthly expenses. &ldquo;In other words, you can&rsquo;t claim $3,000 a month for a car payment,&rdquo; Spaulding says.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Request an &ldquo;Offer in Compromise.&rdquo; </strong>For special circumstances, the IRS will accept less than the full amount due. &ldquo;This typically happens when taxpayers show that the full debt could never be collected or they&rsquo;re disputing how much is owed,&rdquo; Luscombe says. &ldquo;But neither party wants to enter into a legal battle to resolve the issue.&rdquo; To make the request, all filings have to be current, and you can&rsquo;t be part of an open bankruptcy case.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Enter an installment plan. </strong>If you can&rsquo;t qualify for an offer of compromise, you can stretch payments (if the total is less than $50,000) over as much as 72 monthly installments. &ldquo;You do this directly through the Automated Clearing House and avoid a lien filing, garnishments and levies,&rdquo; Spaulding says. &ldquo;To qualify, you&rsquo;re not required to provide full financials like bank statements, pays stubs and bills, as with an Offer in Compromise or Currently Not Collectible situation.&rdquo; A range of user fees apply. As with an Offer in Compromise, all filings have to be current, and you can&rsquo;t be part of an open bankruptcy case.</p>
        <p><strong>How to avoid owing taxes next year</strong></p>
        <p>Obviously, you&rsquo;ll want to spare yourself from this ordeal a year from now. Spaulding suggests these 3 steps:</p>
        <p><strong>Check your W-4. </strong>You have to ensure that your exemptions are accurately listed. &ldquo;If there are too many, then your employer won&rsquo;t withhold enough taxes and you will owe,&rdquo; Spaulding says.</p>
        <p><strong>Be careful about withdrawing from your 403(b) and other retirement plans.</strong> If you&rsquo;re in a tight spot and need that money, set aside enough to pay taxes on it. &ldquo;Since those accounts are funded with pre-tax dollars, all the money you pull out will probably be subject to income tax, plus a 10% penalty in most cases,&rdquo; Spaulding says.</p>

        <p>Tal vez no le fue retenido lo suficiente, se olvid&oacute; de pagar los impuestos estimados para un trabajo adicional o cometi&oacute; otro tipo de error involuntario y ahora debe pagar la factura tributaria que le espera. Esto les sucede a muchos estadounidenses cada a&ntilde;o, y, en ciertos casos, se les dificulta ponerse al d&iacute;a con lo que deben.</p>
        <p>Ahora es m&aacute;s complicado que nunca, ya que el nuevo formulario W-4 implementado en 2020 como parte de la Ley de Recortes de Impuestos y Empleos afect&oacute; las retenciones de las n&oacute;minas. Si usted no actualiz&oacute; sus retenciones en 2020, es posible que haya recibido un poco m&aacute;s en su n&oacute;mina a lo largo del a&ntilde;o, pero eso tambi&eacute;n quiere decir que podr&iacute;a terminar debiendo m&aacute;s de lo normal en impuestos al presentar su declaraci&oacute;n en 2021.</p>
        <p>Adem&aacute;s, si ha recibido alg&uacute;n tipo de beneficios por desempleo en 2020 y <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unemployment-compensation-is-taxable-have-tax-withheld-now-and-avoid-a-tax-time-surprise" target="_blank">no se le retuvieron impuestosd</a>, eso tambi&eacute;n puede aumentar lo que deber&aacute; en la temporada impositiva de 2021. El Plan de Rescate Estadounidense, el &uacute;ltimo paquete de ayuda por el coronavirus aprobado a mediados de marzo de 2021, incluye una exenci&oacute;n al impuesto federal sobre la renta sobre los primeros US$ 10,200 en beneficios por desempleo recibidos en 2020 por las personas que ten&iacute;an un ingreso menor a US$ 150,000.</p>
        <p>Las consecuencias de una factura tributaria elevada e inesperada puede resultar muy costosa: si no puede pagar los impuestos adeudados antes de la fecha l&iacute;mite de la declaraci&oacute;n original, estar&aacute; sujeto a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc202" target="_blank">intereses y multas por pago tard&iacute;o</a>, de acuerdo con el IRS. Este aconseja a los contribuyentes que se encuentran en esta situaci&oacute;n el presentar la declaraci&oacute;n a tiempo, incluso si no les es posible pagar todo el saldo. Y lo mejor es pagar ese saldo lo antes posible para evitar cargos adicionales. En espec&iacute;fico, los cargos adicionales pudieran ascender a recargos del 5% de los impuestos adeudados por cada mes, o fracci&oacute;n de mes, en que la declaraci&oacute;n est&eacute; atrasada, de acuerdo con Mark Luscombe, analista tributario federal titular en Wolters Kluwer Tax &amp; Accounting.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Hace varios a&ntilde;os, el IRS emiti&oacute; nuevas normas para ayudar a amortiguar el impacto para estos contribuyentes&rdquo;, comenta Luscombe, &ldquo;incluyendo el aumento del l&iacute;mite en el que el IRS presenta un gravamen contra su propiedad, cuenta bancaria o salarios, lo que afectar&aacute; las calificaciones crediticias. No obstante, a pesar de los cambios, usted se seguir&aacute; enfrentando a una serie de problemas por no pagar en el momento debido y es necesario que entienda las opciones disponibles para hacer frente a la deuda&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Para conocer m&aacute;s sobre cinco de estas opciones, consultamos a Luscombe y Shawn Spaulding, un abogado fiscalista de San Marcos, California. Como siempre, sus consejos constituyen solo su opini&oacute;n informada. Si usted se encuentra en una situaci&oacute;n en la que enfrenta dificultades para pagar los impuestos que debe, le aconsejamos que busque a un profesional tributario calificado para ayudarle a tomar las mejores decisiones para su caso particular.

Obtenga una pr&oacute;rroga. </strong>En muchos casos, el IRS estar&aacute; en total disposici&oacute;n a ampliar su plazo l&iacute;mite para pagar. &ldquo;Si no puede pagar la factura en el momento debido, pero cree que puede hacerlo en un plazo de 120 d&iacute;as, y si debe menos de US$ 100,000, puede solicitar una pr&oacute;rroga administrativa a corto plazo&rdquo;, comenta Luscombe.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Solicite un pr&eacute;stamo para pagar. </strong>Si requiere m&aacute;s de 120 d&iacute;as, puede considerar la posibilidad de solicitar un pr&eacute;stamo bancario, posiblemente mediante el valor de la vivienda, o incluso con su tarjeta de cr&eacute;dito. Para reducir la carga de intereses de esta &uacute;ltima opci&oacute;n, puede transferir lo que debe a una nueva tarjeta con un tipo de inter&eacute;s inicial favorable. &ldquo;Aunque contraer una deuda para pagar otra podr&iacute;a no parecer una buena opci&oacute;n al principio, la tasa de inter&eacute;s y los cargos aplicados por un banco o por el emisor de la tarjeta de cr&eacute;dito podr&iacute;a ser menor que los intereses y recargos aplicados por el IRS&rdquo;, dice Luscombe. &ldquo;Los pagos a las tarjetas de cr&eacute;dito deben hacerse de manera electr&oacute;nica, com&uacute;nmente mediante un software fiscal personal o de un preparador de impuestos profesional&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Declare dificultades.</strong> Al ser declarada lo que el IRS llama una cuenta &ldquo;actualmente no cobrable&rdquo;, usted recibir&aacute; un aplazamiento del pago oficial si puede demostrar que hacer frente a lo que debe al IRS le impedir&aacute; cubrir sus gastos de subsistencia b&aacute;sicos. &ldquo;Ser &lsquo;actualmente no cobrable&rsquo; no significa que la deuda desaparezca&rdquo;, de acuerdo con lo que dice el IRS en su sitio oficial. &ldquo;Significa que el IRS ha determinado que no puede costear el pago de la deuda en este momento. Los recargos e intereses continuar&aacute;n acumul&aacute;ndose hasta que haya pagado la deuda en su totalidad&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>En este caso, el IRS solicita a los candidatos que llenen una Declaraci&oacute;n de Informaci&oacute;n de Cobro y presenten pruebas de su estado financiero, lo que debe incluir detalles sobre sus activos, ingresos mensuales y gastos. &ldquo;En general, un estado de dificultad financiera evitar&aacute; embargos y suspensiones por 12 meses&rdquo;, comenta Spaulding. &ldquo;Aun as&iacute;, si debe m&aacute;s de US$ 10,000 d&oacute;lares, el IRS registrar&aacute; un gravamen en el condado en el que vive, inmediatamente despu&eacute;s de aprobar el estado de dificultad&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>En cuanto a c&oacute;mo determina el IRS los casos de dificultad, el organismo generalmente eval&uacute;a a lo que ascender&iacute;an los gastos mensuales razonables permisibles. &ldquo;En otras palabras, no puede argumentar un pago de US$ 3,000 al mes para un autom&oacute;vil&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Solicite una &ldquo;Oferta de regularizaci&oacute;n&rdquo; </strong>En circunstancias especiales, el IRS aceptar&aacute; menos del total del monto adeudado. &ldquo;Esto sucede generalmente cuando los contribuyentes demuestran que nunca se podr&iacute;a cobrar la totalidad del adeudo o si se disputa el monto que se debe&rdquo;, dice Luscombe. &ldquo;Pero ninguna de las partes quiere recurrir a una batalla legal para resolver el problema&rdquo;. Para hacer la solicitud, todas las declaraciones deben estar al d&iacute;a, y usted no puede ser parte de un caso abierto de bancarrota.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Entre en un plan de cuotas. </strong>Si no puede calificar para una oferta de regularizaci&oacute;n, puede alargar los pagos (si el total es inferior a US$ 50,000) hasta en 72 cuotas mensuales. &ldquo;Usted hace esto directamente a trav&eacute;s de la C&aacute;mara de Compensaci&oacute;n Automatizada y evita la presentaci&oacute;n de un gravamen, embargos y exacciones&rdquo;, dice Spaulding. &ldquo;Para ser elegible, no es necesario que proporcione los datos financieros completos, como estados de cuentas bancarios, talones de pago y facturas, como en el caso de una oferta de regularizaci&oacute;n o un estado &lsquo;no cobrable&rsquo;&rdquo;. Se aplican una serie de tarifas para el usuario. Como en el caso de una oferta de regularizaci&oacute;n, todas las declaraciones deben estar al d&iacute;a y no puede formar parte de un caso abierto de bancarrota.</p>
        <p><strong>C&oacute;mo evitar tener que pagar impuestos el pr&oacute;ximo a&ntilde;o</strong></p>
        <p>Obviamente, querr&aacute; evitar este suplicio dentro de un a&ntilde;o. Spaulding sugiere estos 3 pasos:</p>
        <p><strong>Verifique su W-4. </strong>Debe asegurarse de que sus exenciones est&aacute;n enumeradas de forma correcta. &ldquo;Si hay demasiadas, su empleador no podr&aacute; retener suficientes impuestos y usted quedar&aacute; debiendo&rdquo;, dice Spaulding.</p>
        <p><strong>Sea cauteloso al retirar dinero de su 403(b) y otros planes de retiro.</strong> Si se encuentra en una situaci&oacute;n dif&iacute;cil y necesita ese dinero, reserve lo suficiente para pagar los impuestos que correspondan. &ldquo;Ya que esas cuentas se financian con dinero antes de impuestos, todo el dinero que retire probablemente estar&aacute; sujeto a impuestos sobre la renta, m&aacute;s una multa del 10% en la mayor&iacute;a de los casos&rdquo;, comenta Spaulding.</p>
