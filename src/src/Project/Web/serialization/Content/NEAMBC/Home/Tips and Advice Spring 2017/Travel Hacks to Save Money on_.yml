                        <p>Are you “vacation deprived”? A recent survey by Expedia revealed that 53% of Americans feel this way. If you’re one of them, you may wish you could pack a bag right now and head off into the sunset. But obstacles—like time and money—stand in the way. We can’t help you manufacture more time, but we can help you on the budget front. Savvy shoppers know that there are dozens of travel hacks to save money on your next trip.

        <p><strong>Airfare Travel Hacks</strong></p>
        
        <p>Airfare can be the single most expensive part of any trip and you know that a lot of the sage advice from experts—like “be flexible with your departure dates and times”—isn’t always easy to heed for an educator with limited vacation days. Still, there are some methods you can use to shave a few dollars off your airfare.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Pick the right times to fly:</strong> More often than not, you have to travel on certain days because those are the days you have off. But try to book early morning or late-night flights. Those options tend to have the lowest price tags (depending on the route). Use <a href="https://matrix.itasoftware.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Google’s Matrix Airfare Search</strong></a> to find the cheapest flights—both nonstops and connections—on the dates you can travel. And, if you do have some flexibility over your travel dates, it can be cheaper to fly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Rethink your route:</strong> Oftentimes, connecting flights are the most inexpensive option—but don’t forget to factor in the vacation time lost as you wait around the airport for your connection. Likewise, if there are multiple airports within driving distance of your home, be sure to check flights departing from each to determine which offers the lowest-cost options to your destination.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Book at the best times: </strong>Airlines are known to launch sales or reduce prices on certain days of the week—Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays in particular. Also, fares are often cheapest 4 to 6 weeks before departure for domestic travel.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Use tools to monitor prices:</strong> It’s always smart to track the price of airline tickets both before and after you buy. Tracking beforehand lets you know what a “good deal” for that route actually looks like. Tracking after you buy can help you recoup a credit if the price of your ticket actually goes down. Some airlines do offer credits in such circumstances but only when the criteria matches company policy (like if you purchased your ticket 60 or more days in advance). Use a free online service like <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/" target="_blank"><strong>Google Flights</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.farecompare.com/" target="_blank"><strong>FareCompare</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Airfarewatchdog</strong></a> to set up automated fare alerts.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Avoid triggering price increases: </strong>Have you ever searched for airfare a few days in a row only to see the price creep up and up and up? Sometimes that’s because the airline is “spying” on your research and is raising the ticket price each time you search. This is called dynamic pricing. If that happens, clear your browser cookies (or, better yet, search using <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Activate-Incognito-Mode" target="_blank"><strong>incognito mode</strong></a> in the first place) and then search your route again. You may find that the price has lowered.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Hotel Travel Hacks</strong></p>
        
        <p>It’s possible to save a few bucks in a couple of different ways when you book your hotel:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Cash in on member discounts:</strong> Luckily, there are plenty of ways to score a pretty hefty discount on lodgings. First of all, don’t forget that your&nbsp;SEIU membership offers <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6643932D038B43019F85F9ED3C1D3C9D&amp;_z=z"><strong>20% savings on rooms at Red Roof Inns</strong></a> throughout the country. You can also book a variety of motels, hotels and resorts through Expedia or Priceline via&nbsp;<strong><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=1EACD919B20F445FBDFD7EA7777EEA75&amp;_z=z">SEIU Click &amp; Save</a></strong> and get special member pricing.</p>
        
        <p>If you have a membership to <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=ECD8C7EE354D4F4ABB66AC388A7BB0F5&amp;_z=z" onclick="ga_event('article', 'click', '15 travel hacks to save money on every aspect of your vacation > costco');"><strong>Costco</strong></a>, don’t miss <a href="http://www.costcotravel.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Costco Travel</strong></a>, which offers discounts on hotels (plus car rentals, vacation packages, cruises and land tours).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Join loyalty programs:</strong> No matter where you plan to stay, ask if there is a loyalty program. Join and sign up to receive email updates. You’ll be the first to know of sales as well as special member-only discounts. Other perks—such as free Wi-Fi, breakfast and room upgrades—are also possible as you make your way up the loyalty program’s tiers.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ask for a discount:</strong> In this day and age when almost everything is done online or from your smartphone, it may not occur to you to call and ask your hotel for a discount. But savvy shoppers do just that! Call the hotel directly, not the chain’s 800 number. Talk with the reservations manager and ask about any “manager’s specials” or other discounts, or ask him or her to beat the price of a competitor. The hotel property itself has more leeway to offer discounts than the corporate headquarters.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Use a travel agent: </strong>Savvy travelers actually call on travel agents who can score value-added perks (like free breakfast or parking), pre-negotiated discount rates and upgraded rooms. Find a travel agent who’s a member of a reputable consortium such as <a href="https://www.virtuoso.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Virtuoso</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.ensembletravel.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ensemble Travel</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.signaturetravelnetwork.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Signature Travel Network</strong></a>.</p>
        
        <p>Book through an online discounter or auction site: Sometimes you can net savings on your hotel by booking through an online site like <a href="https://www.orbitz.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Orbitz</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.expedia.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Expedia</strong></a> as well as resources like <a href="http://www.bookingbuddy.com/" target="_blank"><strong>BookingBuddy.com</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.hotels.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Hotels.com</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.hipmunk.com/hotels" target="_blank"><strong>Hipmunk.com</strong></a>. And, if you’re looking for more upscale digs, try auction site <a href="http://www.jetsetter.com/" target="_blank"><strong>JetSetter.com</strong></a>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Car Rental Travel Hacks</strong></p>
        
        <p>Renting a car can be tricky. Some locations offer a lot of competition across rental companies, which pushes the daily rate lower. In other destinations it’s tough to find a break on the rate. Here are some ways to score discounts:</p>
        
        <p><strong><a href="~/link.aspx?_id=01A71E867A96486D8EED82FB99928311&amp;_z=z" onclick="ga_event('article', 'click', '15 travel hacks to save money on every aspect of your vacation > car rental');">Take advantage of your SEIU member savings</a>: </strong>As an SEIU member, you’re eligible for discount rentals from <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=262C7751A405406697BBBB2F2E18F7C0&amp;_z=z">Alamo</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=55A67C922377443AA56155B8A49375EE&amp;_z=z">Dollar</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=77B55B54018A4E8FB4DE5DE36755E44D&amp;_z=z">Enterprise</a>, <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=E66AA60EF6C64FEAAF90B535BC4C0571&amp;_z=z">Hertz</a> and <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=54B239A49EB347EDA3935DA0D9FCE874&amp;_z=z">National</a>.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Sign up for loyalty programs:</strong> Members of the car rental company’s loyalty program are sometimes entitled to skip lines at the rental desk or net free upgrades.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Compare prices:</strong> Use sites like Orbitz, <strong><a href="https://www.kayak.com/" target="_blank">Kayak</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.carrentals.com/" target="_blank"><strong>CarRentals.com</strong></a> to compare rental prices.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Use discount codes and coupons:</strong> If you make your car rental reservation directly at the company’s website, you’ll notice fields in the process for coupon codes. You can look for one at sites like <a href="https://www.retailmenot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>RetailMeNot</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.ultimatecoupons.com/" target="_blank"><strong>UltimateCoupons.com</strong></a>.</p>
