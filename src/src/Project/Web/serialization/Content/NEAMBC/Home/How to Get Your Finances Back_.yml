        <p>Many of us are likely glad to see the end of 2020. The year began with a global pandemic that triggered a recession. Millions of workers lost their jobs or saw their hours cut. Even the usually stable public service sector saw steep job cuts, many of them in education. (A Labor Department spokesperson told Reuters that 469,000 public school personnel lost their jobs in April 2020 alone.)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The economy, though, continues to slowly recover. And now could be a good time to reassess your finances, getting them back on track or preparing for future setbacks. Here are some tips on how to do so.</p>
        <p><strong>Find mortgage and student loan relief</strong></p>
        <p>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided a respite from payments on government-backed mortgages and federal student loans.</p>
        <p>For example, the law not only placed a moratorium on home foreclosures in 2020, but allows homeowners suffering financial hardship because of Covid-19 to pause their mortgage payments for up to 180 days. If you took advantage of this but your finances haven&rsquo;t recovered within that six-month period, you can request an additional 180 days of forbearance. (Interest on your mortgage continues to accrue during forbearance, and you&rsquo;ll need to repay paused payments in the future.) Contact your mortgage servicer to request a forbearance or extend the relief. </p>
        <p>Payments on federal student loans were also suspended and interest waived through the end of 2020. If you will have difficulty keeping up with payments once they resume, check out various federal repayment programs. An income-driven plan, for example, ties your monthly payments to your income and family size, potentially reducing them to $0. Learn about your repayment options at the NEA Student Debt Navigator. </p>
        <p>Government relief doesn&rsquo;t apply to private loans. But you can still reach out to your loan servicer to see what options are available if you&rsquo;re struggling with payments.</p>
        <p>You might also want to take advantage of today&rsquo;s low interest rates to reduce your payments and borrowing costs by refinancing your private loans through the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=EFD21672146F43DCB295E0B6B5A8810C&amp;_z=z">NEA Student Loan Refinance Program</a>. The program, in partnership with College Ave Student Loans, allows you to choose a loan term from 5 to 20 years so you can choose what works best for your budget.&nbsp; You can also receive a one-time credit of 0.5% of your loan amount (up to $599.99) and get a 0.25% interest rate reduction when you enroll in auto pay.</p>
        <p><strong>Check credit reports</strong></p>
        <p>You&rsquo;re entitled to a free credit report each year from one of the three major credit reporting businesses&mdash;Equifax, Experian and TransUnion&mdash;at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. But during the pandemic, the three bureaus waived this limit, and you can now get a free online report weekly from each through April 2021.</p>
        <p>Review your reports to make sure there aren&rsquo;t any errors in it that could affect your credit score, a critical number used by lenders to quickly assess your creditworthiness. </p>
        <p>Certain relief offered to borrowers during the pandemic, such as mortgage forbearance and suspension of federal student loan payments, are not supposed to appear as negative marks on credit reports. Nevertheless, some borrowers complain that this relief was misreported, damaging their credit scores. </p>
        <p>Dispute these or other errors on your credit report with the credit bureaus and the business that provided the inaccurate information. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provides a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> on how to do so. </p>
        <p><strong>Build a better credit score </strong></p>
        <p>Given this year&rsquo;s recession and the millions of layoffs, you&rsquo;d expect credit scores to crater. Yet the average FICO score&mdash;a widely used measure of creditworthiness&mdash;reached a record high of 711 in July 2020. That&rsquo;s a five-point bump up from a year earlier. (Scores range from 300 to 850, the higher the better.)</p>
        <p>Why the increase?<strong> </strong>Fair Isaac Corp., the creator of the FICO score, says financial relief measures, including enhanced unemployment benefits, stimulus checks and payment accommodations by lenders, helped consumers avoid falling behind on bills. Plus, credit card balances also dropped during the first half of the year as consumers cut back on spending. </p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether consumers can count on additional stimulus checks or other relief. To maintain a good score&mdash;or improve one&mdash;follow these tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay bills on time, which accounts for 35% of your FICO score. </li>
            <li>Reduce debt on credit cards and other revolving accounts. Thirty percent of a FICO score is based on your credit utilization rate, or how much of your available credit you use. The less, the better. Aim to use no more than 30% of your total credit limit.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t close credit card accounts you&rsquo;re not using unless it costs money to keep them open. Keeping unused accounts open increases your total credit limit and improves your credit utilization rate.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Dig out of debt</strong></p>
        <p>You likely didn&rsquo;t accrue debt overnight, so it can take some time to reduce it. Start with the most-costly debt, which is generally credit cards. For example, the average annual percentage rate (APR) on credit cards is about 16%, according to Bankrate.com. But your APR could be more than 20% if you have a weak credit score. </p>
        <p>A popular way to eliminate debt and save on interest is called the &ldquo;avalanche method.&rdquo; You put extra dollars toward repaying the card with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on your other cards. Once the first card is paid off, you put the extra money toward the card with the next highest rate, and so on until the debt is wiped out.</p>
        <p>But if you need the psychological boost that comes from eliminating some debts quickly, try the &ldquo;snowball method.&rdquo; Simply apply extra money to the card with the smallest balance first, regardless of the interest rate. When that&rsquo;s paid off, you tackle the card with the next lowest balance, and so on. The snowball method won&rsquo;t necessarily save on interest, but it can keep you motivated. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can take out a personal loan to pay off high-interest card debt. For example, with an <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6932556F7034419EA7694F7F1FE11AB6&amp;_z=z">NEA Personal Loan</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;the First National Bank of Omaha, you can borrow $5,000 to $30,000<sup>1</sup> at a fixed rate between 5.99% and 15.99% APR<sup>2</sup>, depending on your credit history. Just make sure that if you take out a loan to pay down debt, you don&rsquo;t rack it up again.</p>
        <p><strong>Create or replenish an emergency fund </strong></p>
        <p>The benefit of emergency savings became evident during the pandemic when workers struggled to keep up with bills after a job loss or reduced hours. The general rule is to keep between three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account for emergencies. But the right amount for you will depend on your job security and if you have other reliable household income.</p>
        <p>For example, a dual-income couple may need the standard three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Yet a sole wage earner may need double that. Workers in stable industries may be able to get by with enough savings to cover two to four months&rsquo; worth of expense, while those with jobs that are at risk in economic downturns may want to salt away up to nine months or so of expenses. </p>
        <p>Building an emergency fund can take time, but regularly stowing away small amounts can help it grow to a sizable sum over time. For example, saving $50 a week will amount to $5,200 in two years.</p>
        <p>To help you find the money to fund that account, try this interactive budget worksheet&mdash;Build Your Budget in 6 Easy Steps&mdash;created for NEA members.</p>
        <p>Keep your emergency savings in a separate account with little or no fees and a healthy rate of return. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=20BF1A5E18774B1FBF13352435B343DB&amp;_z=z">NEA Smart Money Account</a>&nbsp;has no monthly fees and offers the potential to earn higher returns&nbsp;on the money you&rsquo;re socking away. Your checking and savings accounts are linked, so your emergency fund will be easily accessible if you suddenly find yourself in need.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Consider bankruptcy as a last resort </strong></p>
        <p>Filing for bankruptcy can provide a much-needed fresh start and stop creditors&rsquo; calls. But it&rsquo;s often referred to as a solution of last resort because of the repercussions. Depending on the type of bankruptcy filing, you may have to forfeit your house and car. You generally can&rsquo;t wipe out student loans in bankruptcy. And a bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for seven to 10 years. </p>
        <p>Before bankruptcy, try negotiating with creditors on a solution. Many credit card issuers, for example, offer hardship programs that may waive fees, lower your interest rate or reduce minimum payments.</p>
        <p>Also consider working with a nonprofit credit counselor. Counselors can help with budgeting to make your finances manageable. They can also negotiate with your creditors to come up with a debt management plan for you. You can find a nonprofit counselor through the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank">National Foundation for Credit Counseling</a>. </p>

When that&rsquo;s paid off, you tackle the card with the next lowest balance, and so on. The snowball method won&rsquo;t necessarily save on interest, but it can keep you motivated. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can take out a personal loan to pay off high-interest card debt. For example, with an <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=4C2742A9F07A44E8B03854F848D6D37A&amp;_z=z">SEIU Personal Loan</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;the First National Bank of Omaha, you can borrow $5,000 to $30,000<sup>1</sup> at a fixed rate between 7.99% and 15.99% APR<sup>2</sup>, depending on your credit history. Just make sure that if you take out a loan to pay down debt, you don&rsquo;t rack it up again.</p>
        <p><strong>Create or replenish an emergency fund </strong></p>
        <p>The benefit of emergency savings became evident during the pandemic when workers struggled to keep up with bills after a job loss or reduced hours. The general rule is to keep between three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account for emergencies. But the right amount for you will depend on your job security and if you have other reliable household income.</p>
        <p>For example, a dual-income couple may need the standard three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Yet a sole wage earner may need double that. Workers in stable industries may be able to get by with enough savings to cover two to four months&rsquo; worth of expense, while those with jobs that are at risk in economic downturns may want to salt away up to nine months or so of expenses. </p>
        <p>Building an emergency fund can take time, but regularly stowing away small amounts can help it grow to a sizable sum over time. For example, saving $50 a week will amount to $5,200 in two years.</p>
        <p>To help you find the money to fund that account, try this interactive budget worksheet&mdash;Build Your Budget in 6 Easy Steps&mdash;created for NEA members.</p>
        <p>Keep your emergency savings in a separate account with little or no fees and a healthy rate of return. The <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=20BF1A5E18774B1FBF13352435B343DB&amp;_z=z">NEA Smart Money Account</a>&nbsp;has no monthly fees and offers the potential to earn higher returns&nbsp;on the money you&rsquo;re socking away. Your checking and savings accounts are linked, so your emergency fund will be easily accessible if you suddenly find yourself in need.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Consider bankruptcy as a last resort </strong></p>
        <p>Filing for bankruptcy can provide a much-needed fresh start and stop creditors&rsquo; calls. But it&rsquo;s often referred to as a solution of last resort because of the repercussions. Depending on the type of bankruptcy filing, you may have to forfeit your house and car. You generally can&rsquo;t wipe out student loans in bankruptcy. And a bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for seven to 10 years. </p>
        <p>Before bankruptcy, try negotiating with creditors on a solution. Many credit card issuers, for example, offer hardship programs that may waive fees, lower your interest rate or reduce minimum payments.</p>
        <p>Also consider working with a nonprofit credit counselor. Counselors can help with budgeting to make your finances manageable. They can also negotiate with your creditors to come up with a debt management plan for you. You can find a nonprofit counselor through the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank">National Foundation for Credit Counseling</a>. </p>

        <p>Many of us are likely glad to see the end of 2020. The year began with a global pandemic that triggered a recession. Millions of workers lost their jobs or saw their hours cut. Even the usually stable public service sector saw steep job cuts, many of them in education. (A Labor Department spokesperson told Reuters that 469,000 public school personnel lost their jobs in April 2020 alone.)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The economy, though, continues to slowly recover. And now could be a good time to reassess your finances, getting them back on track or preparing for future setbacks. Here are some tips on how to do so.</p>
        <p><strong>Find mortgage and student loan relief</strong></p>
        <p>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided a respite from payments on government-backed mortgages and federal student loans.</p>
        <p>For example, the law not only placed a moratorium on home foreclosures in 2020, but it allowed homeowners suffering financial hardship because of Covid-19 to pause their mortgage payments for up to 180 days. If you took advantage of this but your finances haven&rsquo;t recovered within that six-month period, you can request an additional 180 days of forbearance. (Interest on your mortgage continues to accrue during forbearance, and you&rsquo;ll need to repay paused payments in the future.) Contact your mortgage servicer to request a forbearance or extend the relief. </p>
        <p>Payments on federal student loans were also suspended and interest waived through the end of 2020. If you will have difficulty keeping up with payments once they resume, check out various federal repayment programs. An income-driven plan, for example, ties your monthly payments to your income and family size, potentially reducing them to $0. Learn about your repayment options with the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B5DDD3528BE64825ADBD93378B6E3DCE&amp;_z=z">SEIU℠ Student Debt Navigator</a>. </p>
        <p>Government relief doesn&rsquo;t apply to private loans. But you can still reach out to your loan servicer to see what options are available if you&rsquo;re struggling with payments.</p>
        <p>You might also want to take advantage of today&rsquo;s low interest rates to reduce your payments and borrowing costs by refinancing your private loans through the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2A6CE476B49341C9A0EBA63040266B20&amp;_z=z">SEIU℠ Student Loan Refinance Program</a>. The program, in partnership with College Ave Student Loans, allows you to choose a loan term from 5 to 20 years so you can choose what works best for your budget.&nbsp; You can also receive a one-time credit of 0.5% of your loan amount (up to $599.99) and get a 0.25% interest rate reduction when you enroll in auto pay.</p>
        <p><strong>Check credit reports</strong></p>
        <p>You&rsquo;re entitled to a free credit report each year from one of the three major credit reporting businesses&mdash;Equifax, Experian and TransUnion&mdash;at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. But during the pandemic, the three bureaus waived this limit, and you can now get a free online report weekly from each through April 2021.</p>
        <p>Review your reports to make sure there aren&rsquo;t any errors in it that could affect your credit score, a critical number used by lenders to quickly assess your creditworthiness. </p>
        <p>Certain relief offered to borrowers during the pandemic, such as mortgage forbearance and suspension of federal student loan payments, are not supposed to appear as negative marks on credit reports. Nevertheless, some borrowers complain that this relief was misreported, damaging their credit scores. </p>
        <p>Dispute these or other errors on your credit report with the credit bureaus and the business that provided the inaccurate information. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provides a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> on how to do so. </p>
        <p><strong>Build a better credit score </strong></p>
        <p>Given this year&rsquo;s recession and the millions of layoffs, you&rsquo;d expect credit scores to crater. Yet the average FICO score&mdash;a widely used measure of creditworthiness&mdash;reached a record high of 711 in July 2020. That&rsquo;s a five-point bump up from a year earlier. (Scores range from 300 to 850, the higher the better.)</p>
        <p>Why the increase?<strong> </strong>Fair Isaac Corp., the creator of the FICO score, says financial relief measures, including enhanced unemployment benefits, stimulus checks and payment accommodations by lenders, helped consumers avoid falling behind on bills. Plus, credit card balances also dropped during the first half of the year as consumers cut back on spending. </p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether consumers can count on additional stimulus checks or other relief. To maintain a good score&mdash;or improve one&mdash;follow these tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay bills on time, which accounts for 35% of your FICO score. </li>
            <li>Reduce debt on credit cards and other revolving accounts. Thirty percent of a FICO score is based on your credit utilization rate, or how much of your available credit you use. The less, the better. Aim to use no more than 30% of your total credit limit.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t close credit card accounts you&rsquo;re not using unless it costs money to keep them open. Keeping unused accounts open increases your total credit limit and improves your credit utilization rate.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Dig out of debt</strong></p>
        <p>You likely didn&rsquo;t accrue debt overnight, so it can take some time to reduce it. Start with the most-costly debt, which is generally credit cards. For example, the average annual percentage rate (APR) on credit cards is about 16%, according to Bankrate.com. But your APR could be more than 20% if you have a weak credit score. </p>
        <p>A popular way to eliminate debt and save on interest is called the &ldquo;avalanche method.&rdquo; You put extra dollars toward repaying the card with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on your other cards. Once the first card is paid off, you put the extra money toward the card with the next highest rate, and so on until the debt is wiped out.</p>
        <p>But if you need the psychological boost that comes from eliminating some debts quickly, try the &ldquo;snowball method.&rdquo; Simply apply extra money to the card with the smallest balance first, regardless of the interest rate. When that&rsquo;s paid off, you tackle the card with the next lowest balance, and so on. The snowball method won&rsquo;t necessarily save on interest, but it can keep you motivated. </p>
        <p><strong>Create or replenish an emergency fund </strong></p>
        <p>The benefit of emergency savings became evident during the pandemic when workers struggled to keep up with bills after a job loss or reduced hours. The general rule is to keep between three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account for emergencies. But the right amount for you will depend on your job security and if you have other reliable household income.</p>
        <p>For example, a dual-income couple may need the standard three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Yet a sole wage earner may need double that. Workers in stable industries may be able to get by with enough savings to cover two to four months&rsquo; worth of expense, while those with jobs that are at risk in economic downturns may want to salt away up to nine months or so of expenses. </p>
        <p>Building an emergency fund can take time, but regularly stowing away small amounts can help it grow to a sizable sum over time. For example, saving $50 a week will amount to $5,200 in two years.</p>

(Scores range from 300 to 850, the higher the better.)</p>
        <p>Why the increase?<strong> </strong>Fair Isaac Corp., the creator of the FICO score, says financial relief measures, including enhanced unemployment benefits, stimulus checks and payment accommodations by lenders, helped consumers avoid falling behind on bills. Plus, credit card balances also dropped during the first half of the year as consumers cut back on spending. </p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether consumers can count on additional stimulus checks or other relief. To maintain a good score&mdash;or improve one&mdash;follow these tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay bills on time, which accounts for 35% of your FICO score. </li>
            <li>Reduce debt on credit cards and other revolving accounts. Thirty percent of a FICO score is based on your credit utilization rate, or how much of your available credit you use. The less, the better. Aim to use no more than 30% of your total credit limit.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t close credit card accounts you&rsquo;re not using unless it costs money to keep them open. Keeping unused accounts open increases your total credit limit and improves your credit utilization rate.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4. Dig out of debt</strong></p>
        <p>You likely didn&rsquo;t accrue debt overnight, so it can take some time to reduce it. Start with the most-costly debt, which is generally credit cards. For example, the average annual percentage rate (APR) on credit cards is about 16%, according to Bankrate.com. But your APR could be more than 20% if you have a weak credit score. </p>
        <p>A popular way to eliminate debt and save on interest is called the &ldquo;avalanche method.&rdquo; You put extra dollars toward repaying the card with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on your other cards. Once the first card is paid off, you put the extra money toward the card with the next highest rate, and so on until the debt is wiped out.</p>
        <p>But if you need the psychological boost that comes from eliminating some debts quickly, try the &ldquo;snowball method.&rdquo; Simply apply extra money to the card with the smallest balance first, regardless of the interest rate. When that&rsquo;s paid off, you tackle the card with the next lowest balance, and so on. The snowball method won&rsquo;t necessarily save on interest, but it can keep you motivated. </p>
        <p><strong>5. Create or replenish an emergency fund </strong></p>
        <p>The benefit of emergency savings became evident during the pandemic when workers struggled to keep up with bills after a job loss or reduced hours. The general rule is to keep between three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account for emergencies. But the right amount for you will depend on your job security and if you have other reliable household income.</p>
        <p>For example, a dual-income couple may need the standard three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Yet a sole wage earner may need double that. Workers in stable industries may be able to get by with enough savings to cover two to four months&rsquo; worth of expense, while those with jobs that are at risk in economic downturns may want to salt away up to nine months or so of expenses. </p>
        <p>Building an emergency fund can take time, but regularly stowing away small amounts can help it grow to a sizable sum over time. For example, saving $50 a week will amount to $5,200 in two years.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Consider bankruptcy as a last resort </strong></p>
        <p>Filing for bankruptcy can provide a much-needed fresh start and stop creditors&rsquo; calls. But it&rsquo;s often referred to as a solution of last resort because of the repercussions. Depending on the type of bankruptcy filing, you may have to forfeit your house and car. You generally can&rsquo;t wipe out student loans in bankruptcy. And a bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for 7 to 10 years. </p>
        <p>Before bankruptcy, try negotiating with creditors on a solution. Many credit card issuers, for example, offer hardship programs that may waive fees, lower your interest rate or reduce minimum payments.</p>
        <p>Also consider working with a nonprofit credit counselor. Counselors can help with budgeting to make your finances manageable. They can also negotiate with your creditors to come up with a debt management plan for you. You can find a nonprofit counselor through the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank">National Foundation for Credit Counseling</a>. </p>

        <p>Many of us are likely glad to see the end of 2020. The year began with a global pandemic that triggered a recession. Millions of workers lost their jobs or saw their hours cut. Even the usually stable public service sector saw steep job cuts, many of them in education. (A Labor Department spokesperson told Reuters that 469,000 public school personnel lost their jobs in April 2020 alone.)&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The economy, though, continues to slowly recover. And now could be a good time to reassess your finances, getting them back on track or preparing for future setbacks. Here are some tips on how to do so.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Find mortgage and student loan relief</strong></p>
        <p>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided a respite from payments on government-backed mortgages and federal student loans.</p>
        <p>For example, the law not only placed a moratorium on home foreclosures in 2020, but it allowed homeowners suffering financial hardship because of Covid-19 to pause their mortgage payments for up to 180 days. If you took advantage of this but your finances haven&rsquo;t recovered within that six-month period, you can request an additional 180 days of forbearance. (Interest on your mortgage continues to accrue during forbearance, and you&rsquo;ll need to repay paused payments in the future.) Contact your mortgage servicer to request a forbearance or extend the relief. </p>
        <p>Payments on federal student loans were also suspended and interest waived through the end of 2020. If you will have difficulty keeping up with payments once they resume, check out various federal repayment programs. An income-driven plan, for example, ties your monthly payments to your income and family size, potentially reducing them to $0. Learn about your repayment options with the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B5DDD3528BE64825ADBD93378B6E3DCE&amp;_z=z">SEIU℠ Student Debt Navigator</a>. </p>
        <p>Government relief doesn&rsquo;t apply to private loans. But you can still reach out to your loan servicer to see what options are available if you&rsquo;re struggling with payments.</p>
        <p>You might also want to take advantage of today&rsquo;s low interest rates to reduce your payments and borrowing costs by refinancing your private loans through the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2A6CE476B49341C9A0EBA63040266B20&amp;_z=z">SEIU℠ Student Loan Refinance Program</a>. The program, in partnership with College Ave Student Loans, allows you to choose a loan term from 5 to 20 years so you can choose what works best for your budget.&nbsp; You can also receive a one-time credit of 0.5% of your loan amount (up to $599.99) and get a 0.25% interest rate reduction when you enroll in auto pay.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Check credit reports</strong></p>
        <p>You&rsquo;re entitled to a free credit report each year from one of the three major credit reporting businesses&mdash;Equifax, Experian and TransUnion&mdash;at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. But during the pandemic, the three bureaus waived this limit, and you can now get a free online report weekly from each through April 2021.</p>
        <p>Review your reports to make sure there aren&rsquo;t any errors in it that could affect your credit score, a critical number used by lenders to quickly assess your creditworthiness. </p>
        <p>Certain relief offered to borrowers during the pandemic, such as mortgage forbearance and suspension of federal student loan payments, are not supposed to appear as negative marks on credit reports. Nevertheless, some borrowers complain that this relief was misreported, damaging their credit scores. </p>
        <p>Dispute these or other errors on your credit report with the credit bureaus and the business that provided the inaccurate information. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provides a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> on how to do so. </p>
        <p><strong>3. Build a better credit score </strong></p>
        <p>Given this year&rsquo;s recession and the millions of layoffs, you&rsquo;d expect credit scores to crater. Yet the average FICO score&mdash;a widely used measure of creditworthiness&mdash;reached a record high of 711 in July 2020. That&rsquo;s a five-point bump up from a year earlier. (Scores range from 300 to 850, the higher the better.)</p>

        <p><strong>3. Build a better credit score </strong></p>
        <p>Given this year&rsquo;s recession and the millions of layoffs, you&rsquo;d expect credit scores to crater. Yet the average FICO score&mdash;a widely used measure of creditworthiness&mdash;reached a record high of 711 in July 2020. That&rsquo;s a five-point bump up from a year earlier. (Scores range from 300 to 850, the higher the better.)</p>
        <p>Why the increase?<strong> </strong>Fair Isaac Corp., the creator of the FICO score, says financial relief measures, including enhanced unemployment benefits, stimulus checks and payment accommodations by lenders, helped consumers avoid falling behind on bills. Plus, credit card balances also dropped during the first half of the year as consumers cut back on spending.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s unclear whether consumers can count on additional stimulus checks or other relief. To maintain a good score&mdash;or improve one&mdash;follow these tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay bills on time, which accounts for 35% of your FICO score.</li>
            <li>Reduce debt on credit cards and other revolving accounts. Thirty percent of a FICO score is based on your credit utilization rate, or how much of your available credit you use. The less, the better. Aim to use no more than 30% of your total credit limit.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t close credit card accounts you&rsquo;re not using unless it costs money to keep them open. Keeping unused accounts open increases your total credit limit and improves your credit utilization rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4. Dig out of debt</strong></p>
        <p>You likely didn&rsquo;t accrue debt overnight, so it can take some time to reduce it. Start with the most-costly debt, which is generally credit cards. For example, the average annual percentage rate (APR) on credit cards is about 16%, according to Bankrate.com. But your APR could be more than 20% if you have a weak credit score.</p>
        <p>A popular way to eliminate debt and save on interest is called the &ldquo;avalanche method.&rdquo; You put extra dollars toward repaying the card with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on your other cards. Once the first card is paid off, you put the extra money toward the card with the next highest rate, and so on until the debt is wiped out.</p>
        <p>But if you need the psychological boost that comes from eliminating some debts quickly, try the &ldquo;snowball method.&rdquo; Simply apply extra money to the card with the smallest balance first, regardless of the interest rate. When that&rsquo;s paid off, you tackle the card with the next lowest balance, and so on. The snowball method won&rsquo;t necessarily save on interest, but it can keep you motivated.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Create or replenish an emergency fund</strong></p>
        <p>The benefit of emergency savings became evident during the pandemic when workers struggled to keep up with bills after a job loss or reduced hours. The general rule is to keep between three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account for emergencies. But the right amount for you will depend on your job security and if you have other reliable household income.</p>
        <p>For example, a dual-income couple may need the standard three- to six-months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Yet a sole wage earner may need double that. Workers in stable industries may be able to get by with enough savings to cover two to four months&rsquo; worth of expense, while those with jobs that are at risk in economic downturns may want to salt away up to nine months or so of expenses.</p>
        <p>Building an emergency fund can take time, but regularly stowing away small amounts can help it grow to a sizable sum over time. For example, saving $50 a week will amount to $5,200 in two years.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Consider bankruptcy as a last resort</strong></p>
        <p>Filing for bankruptcy can provide a much-needed fresh start and stop creditors&rsquo; calls. But it&rsquo;s often referred to as a solution of last resort because of the repercussions. Depending on the type of bankruptcy filing, you may have to forfeit your house and car. You generally can&rsquo;t wipe out student loans in bankruptcy. And a bankruptcy will stay on your credit report for 7 to 10 years.</p>
        <p>Before bankruptcy, try negotiating with creditors on a solution. Many credit card issuers, for example, offer hardship programs that may waive fees, lower your interest rate or reduce minimum payments.</p>
        <p>Also consider working with a nonprofit credit counselor. Counselors can help with budgeting to make your finances manageable. They can also negotiate with your creditors to come up with a debt management plan for you. You can find a nonprofit counselor through the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank">National Foundation for Credit Counseling</a>.</p>

        <p>Es probable que muchos de nosotros nos alegremos de ver el final de 2020. El a&ntilde;o comenz&oacute; con una pandemia mundial que desencaden&oacute; una recesi&oacute;n. Millones de trabajadores perdieron sus empleos o vieron reducido su horario laboral. Incluso el sector de los servicios p&uacute;blicos, habitualmente estable, sufri&oacute; fuertes recortes de empleo, muchos de ellos en el sector de la educaci&oacute;n. (Un portavoz del Departamento de Trabajo dijo a Reuters que 469 000 miembros del personal de las escuelas p&uacute;blicas perdieron sus empleos solo en abril de 2020).</p>
        <p>Sin embargo, la econom&iacute;a sigue recuper&aacute;ndose lentamente. Y ahora podr&iacute;a ser un buen momento para reevaluar sus finanzas, volver a encarrilarlas o prepararse para futuros contratiempos. Aqu&iacute; tiene algunos consejos sobre c&oacute;mo hacerlo.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Encuentre ayuda para hipotecas y pr&eacute;stamos estudiantiles</strong></p>
        <p>La Ley de Ayuda, Alivio y Seguridad Econ&oacute;mica ante el coronavirus (CARES) supuso un respiro en los pagos de las hipotecas respaldadas por el gobierno y los pr&eacute;stamos estudiantiles federales.</p>
        <p>Por ejemplo, la ley no solo estableci&oacute; una moratoria para las ejecuciones hipotecarias en 2020, sino que permiti&oacute; a los propietarios que sufrieran dificultades financieras a causa de la Covid-19 interrumpir los pagos de sus hipotecas durante un m&aacute;ximo de 180 d&iacute;as. Si se acogi&oacute; a esto pero sus finanzas no se han recuperado en ese periodo de seis meses, puede solicitar otros 180 d&iacute;as de pr&oacute;rroga. (Los intereses de su hipoteca siguen acumul&aacute;ndose durante la pr&oacute;rroga, y tendr&aacute; que devolver los pagos interrumpidos en el futuro). P&oacute;ngase en contacto con el administrador de su hipoteca para solicitar una pr&oacute;rroga o extender la ayuda.</p>
        <p>Tambi&eacute;n se suspendieron los pagos de los pr&eacute;stamos estudiantiles federales y se renunci&oacute; a los intereses hasta finales de 2020. Si va a tener dificultades para mantenerse al d&iacute;a con los pagos una vez que se reanuden, consulte varios programas federales de reembolso. Por ejemplo, un plan basado en los ingresos vincula sus pagos mensuales a sus ingresos y al tama&ntilde;o de su familia, lo que puede reducirlos a cero. Conozca sus opciones de reembolso con el <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=B5DDD3528BE64825ADBD93378B6E3DCE&amp;_z=z">Navegador de Deuda Estudiantil de SEIU℠</a>. </p>
        <p>La ayuda del gobierno no se aplica a los pr&eacute;stamos privados. Pero aun as&iacute; puede ponerse en contacto con el administrador de su pr&eacute;stamo para ver qu&eacute; opciones hay disponibles si tiene problemas con los pagos.</p>
        <p>Tambi&eacute;n puede aprovechar los actuales tipos de inter&eacute;s tan bajos para reducir sus pagos y los costos de los pr&eacute;stamos refinanciando sus pr&eacute;stamos privados a trav&eacute;s del <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2A6CE476B49341C9A0EBA63040266B20&amp;_z=z">
        Programa De Refinanciaci&oacute;n De Pr&eacute;stamos Estudiantiles De SEIU℠</a>. El programa, en colaboraci&oacute;n con College Ave Student Loans, le permite elegir un plazo de pr&eacute;stamo de 5 a 20 a&ntilde;os para que pueda elegir lo que mejor se adapte a su presupuesto.  Tambi&eacute;n puede recibir un cr&eacute;dito &uacute;nico del 0.5% del importe de su pr&eacute;stamo (hasta $599.99) y obtener una reducci&oacute;n del 0.25% del tipo de inter&eacute;s al inscribirse en el pago autom&aacute;tico.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Compruebe los informes de cr&eacute;dito</strong></p>
        <p>YTiene derecho a un informe crediticio gratuito cada a&ntilde;o de una de las tres principales empresas de informes crediticios &mdash;Equifax, Experian y TransUnion&mdash; en <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. Pero durante la pandemia, las tres agencias renunciaron a este l&iacute;mite, y ahora puede obtener un informe gratuito en l&iacute;nea semanalmente de cada una hasta abril de 2021.</p>
        <p>Revise sus informes para asegurarse de que no hay ning&uacute;n error en ellos que pueda afectar a su puntuaci&oacute;n de cr&eacute;dito, una cifra fundamental que utilizan los prestamistas para evaluar r&aacute;pidamente su solvencia.</p>
        <p>Se supone que ciertos alivios ofrecidos a los prestatarios durante la pandemia, como la pr&oacute;rroga de la hipoteca y la suspensi&oacute;n de los pagos de los pr&eacute;stamos estudiantiles federales, no deben aparecer como notas negativas en los informes crediticios. Sin embargo, algunos prestatarios se quejan de que esta ayuda se registr&oacute; err&oacute;neamente, con lo su puntuaci&oacute;n crediticia quedaba da&ntilde;ada.</p>
        <p>Impugne estos u otros errores en su informe crediticio con las oficinas de cr&eacute;dito y con la empresa que proporcion&oacute; la informaci&oacute;n inexacta. La Oficina de Protecci&oacute;n Financiera del Consumidor ofrece una gu&iacute;a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-do-i-dispute-an-error-on-my-credit-report-en-314/" target="_blank">paso a paso</a> sobre c&oacute;mo hacerlo.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Consiga una mejor puntuaci&oacute;n de cr&eacute;dito</strong></p>
        <p>Dada la recesi&oacute;n de este a&ntilde;o y los millones de despidos, cabr&iacute;a esperar que las puntuaciones de cr&eacute;dito se desplomaran. Sin embargo, la puntuaci&oacute;n media FICO &mdash;una medida ampliamente utilizada para medir la solvencia crediticia&mdash; alcanz&oacute; un r&eacute;cord de 711 en julio de 2020. Eso supone un aumento de cinco puntos respecto al a&ntilde;o anterior. (Las puntuaciones van de 300 a 850, cuanto m&aacute;s altas mejor).</p>
        <p>&iquest;A qu&eacute; se debe este aumento? Fair Isaac Corp., el creador de la puntuaci&oacute;n FICO, dice que las medidas de alivio financiero, como el aumento de las prestaciones por desempleo, los cheques de est&iacute;mulo y las facilidades de pago por parte de los prestamistas, ayudaron a los consumidores a no retrasarse en sus facturas. Adem&aacute;s, los saldos de las tarjetas de cr&eacute;dito tambi&eacute;n se redujeron durante la primera mitad del a&ntilde;o, ya que los consumidores recortaron sus gastos.</p>
        <p>No est&aacute; claro si los consumidores pueden contar con m&aacute;s cheques de est&iacute;mulo u otras ayudas. Para mantener una buena puntuaci&oacute;n &mdash;o mejorarla&mdash;, siga estos consejos:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pague las facturas a tiempo, ya que esto representa el 35 % de su puntuaci&oacute;n FICO.</li>
            <li>Reduzca la deuda de las tarjetas de cr&eacute;dito y otras cuentas renovables. El 30% de la puntuaci&oacute;n FICO se basa en su tasa de utilizaci&oacute;n del cr&eacute;dito, o en la cantidad de cr&eacute;dito disponible que utiliza. Cuanto menos, mejor. Procure no utilizar m&aacute;s del 30% de su l&iacute;mite de cr&eacute;dito total.</li>
            <li>No cierre las cuentas de tarjetas de cr&eacute;dito que no est&eacute; utilizando a menos que le cueste dinero mantenerlas abiertas. Mantener abiertas las cuentas que no utiliza aumenta su l&iacute;mite de cr&eacute;dito total y mejora su &iacute;ndice de utilizaci&oacute;n del cr&eacute;dito. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>4. Supere sus deudas</strong></p>
        <p>Es probable que no haya acumulado deudas de la noche a la ma&ntilde;ana, por lo que puede tardar alg&uacute;n tiempo en reducirlas. Empiece por la deuda m&aacute;s costosa, que generalmente son las tarjetas de cr&eacute;dito. Por ejemplo, la tasa porcentual anual (TAE) media de las tarjetas de cr&eacute;dito es de alrededor del 16%, seg&uacute;n Bankrate.com. Pero su TAE podr&iacute;a ser superior al 20% si tiene una puntuaci&oacute;n crediticia insuficiente.</p>
        <p>Una forma popular de eliminar la deuda y ahorrar en intereses se llama "m&eacute;todo de la avalancha". Se destina un dinero extra a pagar la tarjeta con el tipo de inter&eacute;s m&aacute;s alto mientras se realizan los pagos m&iacute;nimos en las dem&aacute;s tarjetas. Una vez pagada la primera tarjeta, destina el dinero extra a la tarjeta con el siguiente tipo de inter&eacute;s m&aacute;s alto, y as&iacute; sucesivamente hasta eliminar la deuda.</p>
        <p>Pero si necesita el impulso psicol&oacute;gico que supone eliminar algunas deudas r&aacute;pidamente, pruebe el "m&eacute;todo de la bola de nieve". Simplemente aplique el dinero extra a la tarjeta con el saldo m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;o primero, independientemente del tipo de inter&eacute;s. Cuando esa est&eacute; pagada, afronte la tarjeta con el siguiente saldo m&aacute;s bajo, y as&iacute; sucesivamente. El m&eacute;todo de la bola de nieve no necesariamente ahorrar&aacute; en intereses, pero puede mantenerle motivado.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Cree o renueve un fondo de emergencia</strong></p>
        <p>Las ventajas de los ahorros de emergencia adquirieron relevancia durante la pandemia, cuando los trabajadores se esforzaron por mantenerse al d&iacute;a con las facturas tras la p&eacute;rdida del empleo o la reducci&oacute;n del horario. La regla general es mantener entre tres y seis meses de gastos de subsistencia en una cuenta de ahorro de f&aacute;cil acceso para emergencias. Pero la cantidad adecuada para usted depender&aacute; de su seguridad laboral y de si tiene otros ingresos familiares fiables.</p>
        <p>Por ejemplo, una pareja con dos fuentes de ingresos puede necesitar disponer de media de tres a seis meses de gastos de manutenci&oacute;n en un fondo de emergencia. Sin embargo, un asalariado &uacute;nico puede necesitar el doble. Los trabajadores de sectores estables pueden arregl&aacute;rselas con unos ahorros suficientes para cubrir los gastos de dos a cuatro meses, mientras que los que tienen empleos que corren peligro en las recesiones econ&oacute;micas pueden tener que guardar hasta nueve meses de gastos m&aacute;s o menos.</p>
        <p>Crear un fondo de emergencia puede tomar tiempo, pero guardar peri&oacute;dicamente peque&ntilde;as cantidades puede ayudar a que crezca hasta convertirse en una suma considerable con el tiempo. Por ejemplo, ahorrar $50 a la semana supondr&aacute; $5200 en dos a&ntilde;os.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Considere la quiebra como &uacute;ltimo recurso</strong></p>
        <p>Declararse en quiebra puede suponer un nuevo comienzo muy necesario y detener las llamadas de los acreedores. Pero a menudo se la considera una soluci&oacute;n de &uacute;ltimo recurso debido a su repercusi&oacute;n. Dependiendo del tipo de declaraci&oacute;n de quiebra, es posible que tenga que renunciar a su casa y a su autom&oacute;vil. Por lo general, en la quiebra no se pueden eliminar los pr&eacute;stamos estudiantiles. Y una quiebra permanecer&aacute; en su informe crediticio de siete a diez a&ntilde;os.</p>
        <p>Antes de la quiebra, intente negociar una soluci&oacute;n con los acreedores. Por ejemplo, muchos emisores de tarjetas de cr&eacute;dito ofrecen programas de dificultades que pueden eximirle de las comisiones, bajar su tipo de inter&eacute;s o reducir los pagos m&iacute;nimos.</p>
        <p>Considere tambi&eacute;n la posibilidad de trabajar con un asesor crediticio sin &aacute;nimo de lucro. Los asesores pueden ayudarle a elaborar un presupuesto para que sus finanzas sean abordables. Tambi&eacute;n pueden negociar con sus acreedores para elaborarle un plan de gesti&oacute;n de la deuda. Puede encontrar un asesor sin &aacute;nimo de lucro a trav&eacute;s de la <a rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nfcc.org/" target="_blank"> Fundaci&oacute;n Nacional para el Asesoramiento Crediticio</a>. </p>
