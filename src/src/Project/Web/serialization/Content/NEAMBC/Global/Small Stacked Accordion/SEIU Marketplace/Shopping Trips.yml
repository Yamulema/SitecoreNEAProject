        <p>When you&rsquo;ve clicked on a link to earn Cash Back at a store, you&rsquo;ve created a Rakuten Shopping Trip. Your Shopping Trip is assigned a unique number, which Rakuten uses to verify your purchase with the store. Your purchases will earn Cash Back only if Cookies are enabled on your computer and you start the Shopping Trip by clicking the activate cash back button on the retailer&rsquo;s page. </p>
        
        If you started a Shopping Trip and didn't make a purchase, Rakuten will still have it recorded in your account for up to three months. This number can come in handy if you ever think you haven't earned Cash Back and you want Rakuten Member Services to look into it.
        
        You can view your past Shopping Trips by visiting your Rakuten account.
